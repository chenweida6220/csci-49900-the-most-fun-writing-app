<h3 align="center">Most Fun Writing Application</h3>
  <p align="center">
    This web application is mostly geared towards neurodivergent people who need more stimulation for their brain to feel engaged with their tasks. People with ADHD may feel understimulated when they are doing uninteresting and repetitive tasks, or doing activities with no immediate rewards or benefits. Neurotypical people can push their minds to focus on the task at hand, but neurodivergent people need extra stimulation or pressure to start a task. This web application aims to provide more stimulation for the brain so that people with ADHD can remain interested when they need to write for extended periods of time and be engaged with their task. However, even if you don’t have ADHD, people who are bored of today’s writing applications can still find value in this web app because it is more customizable, personalized, and fun to use than a lot of today’s popular writing software, such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The vision would be a web writing app that people can use to write for extensive periods of time, whether it be for homework, academic papers, novels, or other types of documents. People should be able to create their own writing “environment” with the app and be able to enable or disable features that they don’t want, so that they can stay focused and motivated to write. 
The target audience is neurodivergent people who need more stimulation for their brain, people who use writing applications for extensive periods of time (for homework, writing novels, etc.), and people who find today’s writing apps boring.
The main problem is that neurodivergent people and people who easily lose focus may feel unmotivated to start writing or struggle with keeping their concentration during writing because the task is not engaging enough. In addition, many of today’s writing applications look boring, and are not allowed to be fun.
Our strategy is to provide multiple kinds of features to combat understimulation in a brain with ADHD, such as being able to set music or background noises, as well as visual stimuli to create a fun writing environment. Users will be able to enable and disable the features they want so that they can personalize the web app with settings that work best for them.
The goal is that users should be able to use this web app for more than just note-taking and be able to create documents such as essays, manuscripts, academic papers, etc. Users should be able to customize the web app in a way that works for them and keep themselves engaged and focused on writing. 
In order to improve people’s writing experience, our product will solve writers’ problems of motivation, distraction, or simply being bored of today’s current writing applications by giving them a new writing app that is fun to use and encouraging of productivity, while still being suitable for professional use. We know if our product works when we see users being able to successfully write up the documents they need, and growing numbers of users that enjoy using the application.
